# 🛤️ Online Reservation System - JavaFX

This is **Task 1** of my **Java Development Internship at Oasis Infobyte**.  
I have developed a **basic Online Reservation System** using **Java and JavaFX**, coded in **Notepad** and executed using the **Command Prompt**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Online Reservation System allows users to:
- Log in securely using credentials.
- Book train tickets by filling in basic details.
- Cancel tickets by providing a valid PNR number.

It simulates a real-world railway reservation system using a simple GUI interface built with JavaFX.
